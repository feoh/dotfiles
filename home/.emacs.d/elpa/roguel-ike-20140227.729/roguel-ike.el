;;; Commentary:

;; Description:

;; The goal of this project is to develop a coffee-break roguelike for Emacs.

;; The complete game will allow the player to create various characters
;; and to make them fulfill challenges like arena fight and short dungeon
;; explorations.

;; There isn't any level system.  Each stat can improve independently, by
;; doing related actions.  For example, sucessfull attacks will at term improve
;; character's strength.

;; Usage:

;; To load the file write this in your Emacs configuration:

;;     (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/roguel-ike/")
;;     (require 'roguel-ike)

;; Then, type `M-x roguel-ike`.

;; * use _y, u, h, j, k, l, b, n_ for movements
;; * use _._ to wait one turn
;; * use _<_ or _>_ to use stairs
;; * use _:_ to get information about your enemies
;; * use _s_ to use a skill
;; * use _q_ to quit

;; State of the project:

;; This project is an experiment :

;; * This is my first serious attempt to create a roguelike
;; * I'm using Emacs Lisp because I want to make it run on Emacs,
;;   but also to gain experience in Lisp programming and to see
;;   how a large Lisp program can be managed

;; Compatibilities:

;; It has been tested on Emacs 24.3.  It doesn't work on Emacs 23.

;; Dependencies:

;; * popup-el: [https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el]

;; License:

;; This program is released under GPLv3 license.

;; See _LICENSE_ for more details.
